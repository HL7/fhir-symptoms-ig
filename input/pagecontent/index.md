### Overview

The purpose and rationale for this guide center around the absence of standardized definitions and formats for symptoms data that hinders effective sharing across providers, leading to data silos and interruptions in critical diagnostic thinking. This initiative aims to decrease missed, delayed, or inaccurate diagnoses by enhancing the documentation and exchange of symptoms, a crucial step in the diagnostic process.  

This guide provides FHIR profiles that structure symptom data for seamless exchange across visits and health systems. This will enhance recognition of symptom patterns, reducing clinician burden by streamlining the diagnostic process, and ultimately support informed diagnostic decision-making, improving outcomes for patients.
