# 01 - Pinned canonicals
Pinned the version of http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/workflow-supportingInfo to 5.2.0%

# 02 - Inherited from FHIR Core
The extension http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/elementdefinition-maxValueSet|5.2.0 is deprecated

# 03 - The codes in this code system are moving to LOINC and THO
Most code systems defined in HL7 IGs will need to move to THO later during the process. Consider giving this code system a THO URL now (See https://confluence.hl7.org/display/TSMG/Terminology+Play+Book, and/or talk to TSMG)

# 04 - We will add conformance clause testing eventually
The html source contains the word 'SHALL' but it is not in a text phrase marked as a conformance clause

# 05 - Newly added LOINC code for Symptoms Absent Observation
Unknown code '111551-8' in the CodeSystem 'http://loinc.org' version '2.81'

# 06 - The value set is the entire ICF code system which is quite large
The value set expansion is too large, and only a subset has been displayed

# 07 - Parameter used for template to include openEHR views
Unknown Parameters: [openehr=true]

# 08 - Include openehr.base to get the OpenEHR archetypes views
The ImplementationGuide is based on FHIR version 4.0.1 but package openehr.base#dev is based on FHIR version 5.0.0. In general, this version mismatch should be avoided - some tools will try to make this work with variable degrees of success, but others will not even try

# 09 - We have requested that the note standard extension be allowed on Element.  The definition of the extension would imply that it should be.
The extension http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/note is not allowed to be used at this point (this element is [BackboneElement, Observation.component]; allowed for this version = e:Resource, e:Composition.section)

# 10 - We are mapping from the logical model to the profile in this guide - the URL is the canonical for this guide
No definition could be found for URL value 'http://hl7.org/fhir/uv/symptoms'

# OPENEHR - We are using the openehr package to get the openEHR archetypes.
This IG is version 4.0.1, while the IG 'openehr.base' is from version 5.0.0

# OPENEHR - A number of errors, warnings, and info messages are generated with the inclusion of the openEHR archetypes.  These are known by Grahame and will be fixed with a future version of the publisher and template.
